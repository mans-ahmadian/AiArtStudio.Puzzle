# Q:
If I want to create short videos (less than 1 minute) what is the best resolution that I need to create the view that it shows good on all platforms (YouTube, Instagram, tick tock, x ,...)

# Response:

If you want your short videos to look sharp and consistent across YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok, X (Twitter), and similar platforms, you should use a vertical (portrait) 9:16 aspect ratio with a resolution that balances quality and compatibility.

Here‚Äôs the best all-platform standard:

## üéØ Recommended Specs

Resolution: 1080 √ó 1920 (Full HD vertical)

Aspect Ratio: 9:16

Frame Rate: 30 fps or 60 fps (60 fps is smoother, preferred for action or trends)

Video Codec: H.264 (MP4)

Bitrate: 8‚Äì16 Mbps for high quality

Audio: AAC, 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz

Why 1080√ó1920?

All major short-video platforms accept it as native format.

High enough quality for modern smartphones, but file sizes stay reasonable.

Avoids unnecessary processing or cropping by the platforms.

## Extra tip:
If you want future-proofing (and your editing device can handle it), you can shoot in 4K vertical (2160 √ó 3840) and export to 1080 √ó 1920 ‚Äî you‚Äôll get sharper text, cleaner zooms, and more flexibility in editing.

If you want, I can give you a table of optimal video dimensions for all platforms so you can see side-by-side what works everywhere. Would you like me to do that?

Here‚Äôs a **side-by-side table** of the best resolutions for short videos across YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok, and X (Twitter), so you can make one version that works everywhere without resizing nightmares:

| Platform                        | Recommended Resolution    | Aspect Ratio | Max Length for Shorts/Reels                | Frame Rate  | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **YouTube Shorts**              | **1080 √ó 1920** (Full HD) | 9:16         | 60 sec                                     | 30 / 60 fps | Higher bitrate (12‚Äì16 Mbps) keeps it crisp.                  |
| **Instagram Reels**             | **1080 √ó 1920**           | 9:16         | 90 sec                                     | 30 / 60 fps | Keep text in the center safe zone to avoid cropping in feed. |
| **TikTok**                      | **1080 √ó 1920**           | 9:16         | 10 min (but short content performs better) | 30 / 60 fps | Supports 4K vertical, but not necessary for most uploads.    |
| **X (Twitter) vertical videos** | **1080 √ó 1920**           | 9:16         | 140 sec (longer for Premium)               | 30 / 60 fps | Videos appear cropped in feed preview ‚Äî safe zone matters.   |
| **Facebook Reels**              | **1080 √ó 1920**           | 9:16         | 90 sec                                     | 30 / 60 fps | Same specs as Instagram Reels.                               |

**Universal ‚ÄúOne-File‚Äù Settings for All Platforms**

* **Resolution:** **1080 √ó 1920**
* **Aspect Ratio:** 9:16
* **Frame Rate:** 60 fps (export at 30 if smoother motion isn‚Äôt needed)
* **Codec:** H.264 (MP4)
* **Bitrate:** 12‚Äì16 Mbps for crisp quality
* **Audio:** AAC, 48 kHz, 320 kbps

**Pro tip:** Keep your main subject and any text inside a **‚Äúsafe zone‚Äù** (about 250px from top and bottom, 200px from each side), because each app overlays UI elements differently.

If you want, I can make you a **visual safe-zone guide template** in 1080√ó1920 that you can use in any video editor so nothing important gets covered.
Do you want me to make that for you?
